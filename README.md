# Patient Intake Form Weekend Project

A Mini Project I created to Review Basic React Fundamentals

### How to run the project

- `npm install` install dependencies first
- `npm run dev` runs the project

Features

- Input fields: name, age, symptoms, and insurance number
- A view to see all of the current patients
- Show a success message with the input values

Technologies:

- [MaterialsUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/)
- Using local storage for now to keep track of the patients.
